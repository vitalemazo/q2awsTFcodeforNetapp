q2 Code for .net 4.8 not 4.5 app resources and pipline


Q2 this is in terraform using cross region since us-east has limitations Deploy artifacts will be in us-west during pipline runs 

 automating .NET Framework deployment with AWS CodePipeline to Elastic Beanstalk, let me summarize the key points to building Ir project.

First, it's crucial to understand that this process allows for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) of Ir .NET Framework applications. It will enable I to automate the entire process from code commit to production deployment.

GitHub repository with a .NET Framework application. From this, the source stage of Ir AWS CodePipeline will be triggered whenever I push code to this repository.

use AWS CodeBuild to compile the .NET Framework application and create an Elastic Beanstalk compatible package. Make sure Ir buildspec file is correctly set up to generate this package. I also want to create a Windows container with a Docker image that contains the .NET Framework SDK. Ensure that all the necessary environment variables are set for the build environment.

 AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I create an application and an environment for this application. Be sure to choose the correct solution stack for Ir application - in this case, a stack compatible with the .NET Framework version I're using.

Finally, I will have to set up Ir AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline will have three stages. The first stage will be 'Source', which will fetch Ir code from GitHub. The second will be 'Build', which uses AWS CodeBuild to compile Ir application. The third and final stage will be 'Deploy', which deploys Ir application to the Elastic Beanstalk environment I created earlier.

Remember, always check the IAM permissions for Ir services. The roles that Ir services are using must have the necessary permissions to access other resources.

In summary, automating Ir .NET deployments using AWS services like CodePipeline and Elastic Beanstalk can greatly improve Ir CI/CD workflows. It might seem complex initially, but once set up, it can save I a considerable amount of time and effort in the long run.
